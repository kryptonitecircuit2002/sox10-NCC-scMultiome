This is a pipeline to analyse multi-modal multiome datasets of sox10+ NCCs. It uses Seurat v5.1.0 and Signac v1.14.0 to analyse, integrate and visualise differences across conditions
The kit used for the run was 10X Genomics Single cell ATAC + 3' Gene Expression kit and was sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 1000 platform
The input files are:
1) .h5 count matrix 
2) .tsv.gz fragments file
3) .barcode_metrics.csv file, all generated by Cellranger arc-v8 pipeline

The experiment was carried out in 24 hpf sox10+/gfp zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.
